    <p>Sandwich with vegemite and butter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two slices of sandwich bread.</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Vegemite</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay out the bread, grab a butter knife.</li>
        <li>Spread butter across one side of both pieces of bread.</li>
        <li>Spread vegemite across buttered sides of the bread. Beginners should aim for a brown color mixed with the butter. Advanced eaters may paint the bread with vegemite until it's the same color as it was out of the jar.</li>
        <li>Close the coated sides of the bread together to finish the sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
